For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The RoadTrip Runner will allow users to enter point A, and point B, and be given a listing of various 
suggested stops along the way including, restaurants, museums, state/national parks, landmarks, amusement parks, 
etc. A team member created this idea as she was currently struggling to plan a fun family road 
trip for Summer 2022 from STL to California. The RoadTrip Runner will provide an easy one-stop-shop for creating
a fun road trip for all ages. 
### Features
User Log In - users will be able to create an account and log in 
User Save - users wil be able to add location to their road trip, and save their road trip itinerary to their account 
Point A to Point B - users will be able to enter point A and point B & be shown fun locations in between

### Technologies
Java 
Hibernate 
Spring 
Thymeleaf --> hopefully Angular 
SQL

### What I'll Have to Learn
There is definitely a MASSIVE learning curve on this project. Google Maps APIs are brand new to me and 
my group, thus will need to learn to utilize the mapping feature through APIs involved in our project. As of right now, 
I am really struggling with where to begin on this project. As our mentor thought it was a good idea, I know it 
can be accomplished, but it is so vastly different than the projects we worked on in Unit 1 and 2.
